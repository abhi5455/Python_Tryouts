## Some Python Programs for Beginners
1. HelloWorld
2. Cost Discount Calculator
3. Multiplication Table
4. You are given a list marks that has the marks scored by a class of students in a Mathematics test. Find the average and median marks and store it in a float variable named median. You can assume that marks is a list of float values.
5. Convert a String to both Upper and Lower Case
6. Accept a string as input, convert it to lower case, sort the string in alphabetical order, and print the sorted string to the console. You can assume that the string will only contain letters.
7. You are given the dates of birth of two persons, not necessarily from the same family. Your task is to find the younger of the two. If both of them share the same date of birth, then the younger of the two is assumed to be that person whose name comes first in alphabetical order (names will follow Python's capitalize case format).
   The input will have four lines. The first two lines correspond to the first person, while the last two lines correspond to the second person. For each person, the first line corresponds to the name and the second line corresponds to the date of birth in DD-MM-YYYY format. Your output should be the name of the younger of the two.
8. Slicing: Extracting a sublist from a list
